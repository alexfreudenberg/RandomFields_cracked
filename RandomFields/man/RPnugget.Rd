\description{
 Method to simulate the Nugget effect. (Only for advanced users)
}

\usage{
RPnugget(phi, boxcox, tol, vdim)
}

\arguments{
 \item{phi}{object of class \code{\link[=RMmodel-class]{RMmodel}};
 specifies the covariance model to be simulated. The only possible
 model for \code{phi} is \command{\link{RMnugget}}.}
 \item{boxcox}{the one or two parameters of the box cox transformation.
  If not given, the globally defined parameters are used.
  See \command{\link{RFboxcox}} for details.
 }
\item{tol}{
   points at a distance less than or equal to \code{nugget.tol}
 are considered as being identical. This strategy applies to
 the simulation method and the covariance function itself.
 Hence, the covariance function is only positive definite
 if \code{nugget.tol=0.0}. However, if the anisotropy matrix
 does not have full rank and \code{nugget.tol=0.0}, then
 the simulations are likely to be odd. 
 The value of \code{nugget.tol}
 should be of order \eqn{10^{-15}}{1e-15}.
 
 Default: \code{0.0}
 }
 \item{vdim}{positive integer; the model is treated
   \code{vdim}-variate, \code{vdim=1} (default) corresponds to a
   univariate random field.
   Mostly, the value of \code{vdim} is set automatically.

   Default is that it takes the value of the submodel \code{phi}.}
}
 

\details{
  \describe{
    \item{General}{
      This method only allows \command{\link{RMnugget}} as a submodel.
    }
    
    \item{Anisotropy}{
      The method also allows for zonal nugget effects. Only there the
      argument \code{tol} becomes important.
      For the zonal nugget effect, the anisotropy matrix \code{Aniso}
      should be given in \command{\link{RMnugget}}. There, only the
      kernel of the 
      matrix is important.
    }

    \item{Points close together}{
      The 
      locations at a distance less than or equal to the \link{RFoptions}
      \code{nugget.tol}
      are considered as being identical. This strategy applies to
      the simulation method and the covariance function itself.
      Hence, the covariance function is only positive definite
      if \code{nugget.tol=0.0}. However, if the anisotropy matrix
      does not have full rank and \code{nugget.tol=0.0}, then the
      simulations are likely to be odd.  
      The value of \code{nugget.tol}
      should be of order \eqn{10^{-15}}{1e-15}.
    }
    
    \item{Repeated measurements}{
      Measurement errors are mathematically not distinguishable from spatial
      nugget effects as long as measurements are not repeated at the very
      same space-time
      location. So there is no need to distinguish the spatial nugget
      effect from a measurement error.
      This is the default, see
      \code{allow_duplicated_locations} in \link{RFoptions}.
      
      In case several measurement have been taken in single space-time
      locations,
      measurement errors can be separated from spatial noise.
      In this case \code{RMnugget()} models the measurement error (which
      corresponds to a non-stationary model in an abstract space) by
      default and the
      measurement error model cannot be extended beyond the given
      locations.
      On the other hand \code{RMnugget(Ansio=something)} and
      \code{RMnugget(proj=something)} model the spatial nugget effect
      (with and without zonal anisotropy in case \code{Aniso} has low and
      full rank respectively).
    }

    \item{Role of \command{RPnugget}}{
      Even for advanced users, there is no need to call
      \command{RPnugget} directly, as this is done internally when
      the \link{RMnugget} is involved in the covariance model.
    }
  }
}

\value{
 \code{RPnugget} returns an object of class
 \code{\link[=RMmodel-class]{RMmodel}}.
