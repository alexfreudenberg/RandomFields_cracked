\title{Pressure and temperature forecast errors over the Pacific Northwest}
\usage{data(weather)}
\description{
 Meteorological dataset, which consists of differences between forecasts
 and observations (forecasts minus observations) of temperature and
 pressure at 157 locations in the North American Pacific Northwest. 
}
\format{
  The data frame \code{weather} contains the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{pressure}{in units of Pascal}
    \item{temperature}{in units of degree Celcius}
    \item{lon}{longitudinal coordinates of the locations}
    \item{lat}{latitude coordinates of the locations}
  }
  
  Furthermore, some results obtained from the data analysis in
  \code{\link{jss14}} are delivered that are
  \code{pars.model}, \code{pars}, \code{whole.model}, \code{whole}.
  
  Finally, the variable \code{information} contains packing information
  (the date and the version of \pkg{RandomFields}).
}
\details{
 The forecasts are from the GFS member of the University of Washington
regional numerical weather prediction ensemble (UWME; Grimit and Mass
2002; Eckel and Mass 2005); they were valid on December 18, 2003 at 4 pm
local time, at a forecast horizon of 48 hours.

The data were obtained from Cliff Mass and Jeff Baars from the University
of Washington Department of Atmospheric Sciences.
